Peer Evaluation:
- Siddhant Bhale:
  Sid was a great team-mate to work with as he showed great leadership skills, controlled what everyone in our group was doing, and contributed greatly to the group project. He worked mostly on the code, but also helped minh
  with the designs of the ev3, as well as some of the portfolio
  Role: Coder
- Minh Mai:
  Minh was also a good team-mate, although I didn't interact much with his part of the project. He worked mostly on the design aspect of the project, and
  helped a lot when choosing ways for the ev3 robot to move, interact with blocks and behave when seeing obstacles. In addition, he helped a lot with the research projects. In general, he was great to work with and promoted good work ethic
  for everyone on our team
- Kai Darling:
  Kai worked closely with me, and was a great addition to our team. Having the broadest range of skills, from programming to design, he helped with the portfolio, programming and the design. He was a great addition to the team when required
  Furthermore, he was extremely useful for research, as he was the one that controlled most of the graphics as well as helping Siddhant with the programming. While he didn't work on the research task outright, he was the one that created
  a list of all the information that was required for it, making him exceptionally useful

Overall, my peers helped me succeed in what I was aiming for, and while there were some distractions, our work ethic made it clear that despite not working hard enough in class, we all worked exceptionally well at home and completed all
the tasks that were required of us.

Project Evaluation:
In general, I am quite happy with the project as I hvae felt a lot more confident working on these types of projects. The research project really helped me expand my boundaries, and really aided my final result.
In total, I think I did a lot of work and had a great work ethic, although I can see that I was quite distracted in class some days. Luckily, During the last few weeks, I worked much harder and was able to complete a lot of 
work in general. My main task was with the portfolio, which I worked extremely hard on, and focused most lessons to get it completed. However, in addition, I did help with other things, like the design and the research task. Unfortunately,
I wasn't as involved in the programming as I would have liked to be, but Siddhant and Kai were more experienced, and therefore more suitable for the job, although I did help a little and learned a lot from the task.
